This directory contains image assets for the application.

In a production environment, these would be dynamically generated or stored images.

For the demo, you'll need to provide images with filenames:
- desk-setup.jpg (an image of a desk with productivity items)
- phone-clock.jpg (an image of a phone displaying a clock)
